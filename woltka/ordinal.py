    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm is the core of this module. It uses a flattened, sorted
    list to store starting and ending coordinates of both genes and reads.
    Only one round of traversal (O(n)) of this list is needed to accurately
    find all gene-read matches.

    Refer to its unit test `test_match_read_gene` for an illustrated example.

    This function is the most compute-intensive step in the entire analysis,
    therefore it has been deeply optimized to increase performance wherever
    possible. Notably, it extensively uses bitwise operations to extract
    multiple pieces of information from a single integer.

    Specifically, each coordinate (an integer) has the following information
    (from right to left):

    - Bits  1-30: Index of gene / read (30 bits, max.: 1,073,741,823).
    - Bits    31: Whether it is a gene (1) or a read (0) (1 bit).
    - Bits 32-58: Whether it is the start (positive) or end (0) of a gene /
                  read. If start, the value represents the effective length of
                  an alignment if it's a read, or 1 if it's a gene (17 bits,
                  max.: 131,071).
    - Bits 59-  : Coordinate (position on the genome, nt) (unlimited)

    The Python code to extract these pieces of information is:

    - Coordinate:       `code >> 48`
    - Effective length: `code >> 31 & (1 << 17) - 1`, or `code >> 31 & 131071`
    - Gene or read:     `code & (1 << 30)`
    - Gene/read index:  `code & (1 << 30) - 1`

    Note: Repeated bitwise operations are usually more efficient that a single
    bitwise operation assigned to a new variable.

    This is a dummy function which is only for test and demonstration purpose,

    The formal function `match_read_gene` extensively uses bitwise operations
    and thus is hard to read. Therefore the current function, which represents
    the original form of prior to optimization, is retained.
