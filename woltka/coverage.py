"""Functions for calculating coverage of subject sequences.

The "coverage" refers to the ranges of a subject sequence (e.g., genome) that
are covered by at least one query sequence (e.g., short sequencing read).

The functions `merge_ranges` and `parse_ranges` were modified based on the
`SortedRangeList` class implemented by Daniel Hakim (@dhakim87) in the Zebra
Filter program (https://github.com/ucsd-cmi/zebra_filter).

    -------

    Notes

    Ranges that have overlaps will be merged into one. For example:

    Parameters

    covers : dict of list
        Subject coverage data structure.
    chunk : int, optional

    Notes
    -----
    The `covers` data structure is a dictionary, where the key is a tuple of
    (sample, subject), and the value is a list. The first element of the list
    is an integer indicating how many new ranges have been added since last
    merge, and the remaining elements are individual ranges.

    Once the range counter reaches the threshold specified by `chunk`, an
    operation will be automatically triggered to merge small ranges into large,
    continuous ones, so as to reduce memory space and to improve downstream
    operations.
